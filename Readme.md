# HELLO COCHELLA

this is a script that lets u use keyboard input
The actual programming side is pretty caveman, but i think python is just bad for detecting input. Tried a version previously or C++, and it had 0 input lag or anything.
The example in question was a single keyCombo of windows+tab, so maybe not as impressive as a continuoius input detection loop, but felt far quicker (maybe because it uses less cpu idk)

### CONTROLS: 
- up down left right - moves in those Axis
- ~~shift + up,down,left,right - moves double those axis~~
- ctrl - Recenter
- / - Unlock mouse
- Caps Lock - Toggle between: short range, long range, mixed (max range, but short step)
- ` (tilde (next to 1)) - cancel execution

To use this effectively, you need to make sure you use:
- locked cam
- Attack  to move
- bound right click to space (unless you find something easier)
- be ok with people calling you slurs for playing the game at such a hard handicap

If you play with this correctly YOU WILL GET CHALLENGER!!!!!
Keep on grindin gamers
